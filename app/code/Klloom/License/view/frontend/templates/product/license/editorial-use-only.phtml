<p><span style="color: #000000">Images Marked "Editorial Use Only":</span></p>
<p>Photos marked as "Editorial Use Only" are <span style="color: #000000">not</span> allowed to be used for any commercial purpose, including promotional, endorsement, advertorial, advertising or merchandising purpose. Since this kind of image do not have all the applicable model and property releases, it is intended to be used only in connection with events that are newsworthy or of general interest (for example, in a blog, textbook, magazine article or newspaper). When the use intended for the image has both commercial and non-profit characteristics, the commercial purpose must always be considered as the primarily use and, for that reason, the use of the image is not allowed either.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">You should (probably) mark your photo as Editorial Use Only if:</span>
<p><span style="color: #000000">1)</span> You are a celebrity, public figure or model, and you appear in the photo.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">2)</span> You haven’t been authorized by all models and/or properties owners/representatives that appear or have their property depicted in your photo with a valid Release.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">3)</span> You don’t want your photo to be used for commercial purposes (for whatever reason).</p>
