            <p id="Intro">This License Agreement presents the terms and conditions between you, your employer, or any other client or end-user on whose behalf you are purchasing a license, as the Licensee (You or “Licensee"), and Klloom Conteúdo Ltda. (“Klloom”), as the Licensor. It explains how you can use photos that you license from Klloom. Please read this Agreement carefully before downloading any image. By downloading Visual Content from Klloom, you accept the terms of this Agreement, as well as Klloom’s Privacy Policy and Klloom’s Terms of Use. This agreement is valid together with any invoice of your purchase.</p>
            <p>Overview of this License Agreement: <span style="color: #f19106;">you can use the image without the need to pay royalties or license fees for each use or for time period of use. Image’s author can sell their image through other commercial licensing vendors, or directly to commercial buyers, or they may have licensed it commercially in the past. However, the image must not be available on any free stock image bank (such as Pexels or Unsplash). A KSL image can be sold on an unlimited basis, which means that downloads are not restricted in terms of quantity while it's available on Klloom's platform. You may copy, distribute, display, and perform the work and make derivative works and remixes based on for personal and commercial purposes without the need of attribution or endorsement, including any work of communication and advertising for both digital or press media, but not including the use on products, services and prints for resale, distribution or rental where the primary value lies in the content itself. Licensees are not authorized to resell the original image as a standalone file or make it available for download on other stock image banks or any download sharing platforms. Licensees can not use the image for adult content (NSFW) or in an offensive manner (obscene, rude, defamatory). Images marked as "Editorial Use Only” must not be used for any commercial, promotional, endorsement, advertorial, advertising or merchandising purpose.</span>
            </p>

            <h2 id="Kinds of Licenses Klloom Offers">1. Kinds of Licenses Klloom Offers</h2>
            <p>So far, Klloom offers one type of license: Klloom Standard License (Standard License, or just KSL). All files downloaded from Klloom are under a Standard License, and your use of any Visual Content downloaded from Klloom is subject to the Standard License terms.</p>
            <p>"Editorial Use Only” Mark<br/>Images marked "Editorial Use Only” add an exception to the Klloom Standard License. See the Restrictions section of this Agreement to know more.</p>

            <h2 id="How Can You Use Visual Content Under Our Standard License">2. How Can You Use Visual Content Under Our Standard License</h2>
            <p>You can use Visual Content licensed from Klloom in any manner that is not mentioned in our Restrictions section (see Restrictions below). Subject to those restrictions and the rest of the terms of this agreement, Klloom grants the following rights to you:</p>
            <ol type="a">
                <li>Unlimited: you can use the photo in an unlimited number of projects and in any media, and reproduce the content on an unlimited basis (in physical print or electronic form).</li>
                <li>Perpetual: there is no expiration or end date on your rights to use the image.</li>
                <li>Non-exclusive: you do not have exclusive rights to use the photo. Klloom (or other licensing vendors of the image) may license the same photo to other customers. However, image’s author is not allowed to make the image available on free stock image banks.</li>
                <li>Single User: this license is granted to one Licensee (you). Additional licenses must be obtained for each member of your organization or company who will use the image.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Make sure you read also the entire Restrictions section below for exceptions on the Standard License.</p>

            <h2 id="Restrictions">3. Restrictions</h2>
            <p>You are not allowed to use the image in the following cases:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Images Marked "Editorial Use Only". You must not use photos marked "Editorial Use Only" for any commercial, promotional, endorsement, advertorial, advertising or merchandising purpose. Since this kind of image does not have all the applicable model and property releases, it is intended to be used only in connection with events that are newsworthy or of general interest (for example, in a blog, textbook, magazine article or newspaper). When the use intended for the image has both commercial and non-profit characteristics, the commercial purpose must always be considered as the primarily use and, for that reason, the use of the image is not allowed either.</li>
                <li>Products for Resale. You must not incorporate the image into any products or services intended for resale or distribution where the primary value lies in the image itself including, without limitation, screensavers or wallpapers for mobile devices, website designs, cards, digital templates, stationary items, paper products, calendars, apparel items, posters (printed on paper, canvas, or any other media), DVDs, mobile applications or other items for resale, license or other distribution for profit. This also includes "on demand" goods in which photo is selected by a third party for customization on such product on a made-to-order basis, including, without limitation, mugs, postcards, posters, t-shirts and other items (this includes the sale of products through custom designed websites).</li>
                <li>Logos or Trademarks. You must not use the image as part of a logo, trademark, design mark or service mark.</li>
                <li>Standalone File Use. You are not authorized to resell or use the original image in any way that allows others to download, extract, or redistribute content as a standalone file (meaning just the content file itself, separate from the project or end use) or make it available for download on other stock image banks.</li>
                <li>False Representation of Authorship. You must not give a false impression that you are the original author of a work that is made up mainly of licensed images. As an example, you cannot claim that you are the author of an illustration you made totally from licensed visual content, unless the original images are remixed in a way that is barely possible to identify them.</li>
                <li>Illegal Use. You may not use the photo in a defamatory, pornographic, offensive, discriminatory or other unlawful manner.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2 id="Who, Besides Me, Can Use the Photo?">4. Who, Besides Me, Can Use the Photo?</h2>
            <p>You cannot transfer or sublicense the rights granted to you in this terms to anyone else. There are two exceptions, though:</p>
            <ol type="a">
                <li>Employer or Client. In the case you are purchasing the photo on behalf of your employer or client, then your employer or client is allowed to use the image, as long as you state and guarantee that you have full legal authority to bind your employer or client to the terms of this license agreement. If you do not have that permission, then your employer or client must not use the photo.</li>
                <li>Subcontractors. In the case of any production or distribution process related to your final project or final use, subcontractors (for instance, a printer or retouching studio) or distributors are allowed to use the image. However, these subcontractors and distributors must not use the photo for purposes other than those mentioned above.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2 id="Intellectual Rights and Attribution">5. Intellectual Rights and Attribution</h2>
            <p>All licensed photos are owned by either Klloom or the authors of the Visual Content. All rights not expressly granted in this agreement are reserved by Klloom and the photo suppliers.</p>
            <p>Attribution<br/>You do not need to include a credit for any Visual Content licensed from Klloom.</p>

            <h2 id="Termination/Cancellation/Removal">6. Termination/Cancellation/Removal</h2>
            <ol type="a">
                <li>Termination. This agreement will remain effective until it is terminated by either Klloom or the licensee. You can terminate this agreement by stopping using the Visual Content and deleting or destroying any copies of it. Klloom may terminate this agreement at any time if you infringe any of its terms, in which case you must immediately: stop using the Visual Content; delete or destroy any copies; and, if requested, confirm to Klloom in writing that you have complied with these requirements.</li>
                <li>Refunds and Cancellation. Klloom does not offer refunds for any downloaded files, unless in those cases based on technical issues with the file, at the sole discretion of Klloom. All requests for refunds or cancellations must be made in writing, by email. If the request is approved, we will issue a credit to your credit card.</li>
                <li>Content Removal. We may stop licensing any photo of Klloom at any time in our sole discretion. If either Klloom or you acknowledge that any content may be subject to a claim of infringement of a third party's right for which Klloom may be liable, we may ask you to immediately, and at your own expense: stop using the photo, delete or destroy any copies; and ensure that your clients, distributors and/or employers do the same. Klloom will provide you with up to three (3) replacement options (determined by Klloom in its reasonable discernment) from which you can choose one (1), totally free of charge. The replacement image will be subject to the other terms of this agreement.</li>
            </ol>

                </li>
            </ol>

            <h2 id="General Terms">9. General Terms</h2>
