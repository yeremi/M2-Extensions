However, when you transfer Content to Klloom, you give us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, transferable license to store, use, reproduce, adapt (so we can properly post your Content), distribute and publicly display your Content in order to supply Klloom with the material that Klloom is supposed to show on its web sites, services and products. Klloom will not sell your photos without your permission.</p>
            <p>In addition, if you choose to upload Visual Content, it will automatically be posted for sale to the public, and the following terms and conditions apply in addition to the general Terms. A reference to the ‘purchase’ or ‘sale’ of Visual Content means the acquisition of a Customer License (as described below) to use Visual Content.</p>
            <p>Klloom’s platform allows users to post Visual Content for sale to the public. Visual Content is licensed directly by Klloom to users in accordance with an end user license agreement (Customer License). To license Visual Content you must be at least 18 years of age and have a valid Klloom account, as well as a valid PayPal account. When you post Visual Content on Klloom for sale (in order to sell it on our Site), you give us a non-transferable, worldwide, royalty-free license (with the right to sublicense) to sell this Visual Content on your behalf to other users, under our Terms of License and complying with the Contributor Terms.

            <p>You are responsible for any Content you upload to Klloom. You must assume all risks associated with it, including accuracy, intellectual property claims, or any other legal rights claims. You must state and guarantee that (i) you either own the Content you post, or that you have all necessary rights to post that Content on Klloom, (ii) your Content does not infringe any third party’s rights, and (iii) you can grant the licenses you are asked to grant in these Terms. We reserve the right (though we have no obligation) to refuse or remove any Content you post or transfer to Klloom that (1) is not in accordance with our Behavior Guidelines, (2) is not a proper or allowed Visual Content, (3) infringes any third party’s rights or (4) is offensive, racist, discriminatory (in any way), homophobic, transphobic, sexually explicit or pornographic, (5) is inaccurate, self-promoting or spam, (6) is generated by a robot, spider, scraper or other automated means.</p>
            <p>When you upload to Klloom, you agree to allow other Klloom users to view, distribute and display Klloom’s page and low-resolution previews related to your Content. Be aware that the Content you post on Klloom may become publicly available indefinitely since it may be distributed by other Klloom users through social media by clicking on our Share Button or in any other way, or be cached on third party search engines, even after your Klloom account is suspended or removed. Consider that it is extremely difficult to remove content from the Internet after it becomes publicly available.</p>
            <p>Unless requested by law enforcement or the government, or as otherwise allowed by our Privacy Policy, Klloom will never sell, distribute or share your Visual Content outside of Klloom without your permission.

When your account or Content is deleted, you no longer have the right to access the account or the Content. Although we make a great effort to remove all of your Content from Klloom after your account or Content is deleted, there may be a delay between the cancelation event and the time your Content or account will become publicly invisible, due to technical or operational limitations. Be aware that Klloom may keep backups of Content on its servers, and some of your Content may remain on our servers (though not publicly available) even after you ask to have it deleted. In addition, it may happen that your Content becomes permanently unrecoverable after you remove your account or Content. For that reason, Users are instructed to keep their own copies of all Visual Content posted on the Site.</p>
            <p>Please be aware you do not have any right to cancel the permissions granted by you herein, nor to seek, obtain, or enforce any injunctive or other equitable relief against Klloom, all of which such rights are hereby explicitly and permanently waived by you in favor of Klloom.</p>
