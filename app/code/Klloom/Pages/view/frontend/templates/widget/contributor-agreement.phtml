            <p id="Intro">This Contributor Agreement, or Contributor Terms, is being offered to you (“you”, “User”, “Photographer” or “Contributor”) as a registered user of the Klloom Website (“Website" or “site"), a service of Klloom Conteúdo Ltda (“we”, “Klloom” or “Company”) to license Images (“Images”, “Uploaded Images” or “Visual Content”) to other users. By clicking Upload, you agree to the terms below and allow Klloom to sell, distribute and license your Visual Content on your behalf worldwide.</p>

            <h2 id="Glossary">1. Glossary</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>“<span style="color: #000">Uploaded Images</span>”, “<span style="color: #000">Images</span>” or “<span style="color: #000">Visual Content</span>” means any Contributor photographs uploaded to Klloom Website, which includes any associated tags, metadata, keywords, descriptions, copyright management information, captions and credits.</li>
                <li>“<span style="color: #000">Legal Action</span>” means claims, actions, demands, suits or proceedings made by or on behalf of Klloom with respect to the unauthorized use of Uploaded Images.</li>
                <li>“<span style="color: #000">Gross License Fees (or Gross Earnings)</span>” means the total amount of license fees received by Klloom prior to any deductions. Deductions from gross license fees include sales tax, use tax or any other taxes or duties, currency conversion costs, PayPal fees and bank transfer fees;</li>
                <li>“<span style="color: #000">Net License Fees (or Net Earnings)</span>” means the gross license fees received by Klloom after deduction of sales tax, use tax or any other taxes or duties, currency conversion costs, PayPal fees and bank transfer fees;</li>
                <li>“<span style="color: #000">Similar</span>” means an Image that is identical or significantly similar to an Uploaded Image, including without limitation, an Image whose principal elements are depicted in a way that would cause an industry professional to believe they are substantially the same if they are compared side by side.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="Uploading and Removing Images">2. Uploading and Removing Images</h2>
            <p>2.1. Once you upload Images to Klloom they will be subject to the terms of this Agreement. Images uploaded will be submitted for non-exclusive licensing under our Terms of License. Even though Klloom doesn’t curate or select Images prior to them being posted, all Visual Content may be in accordance with our Behavior Guidelines.</p>
            <p>2.2. As a User, you can delete your Visual Content from Klloom at any time. Additionally, we reserve the right to remove your Images at any time, with or without prior notice, in the event we judge you are not acting according to our Behavior Guidelines, for security reasons or due to a server breakdown. When your Images are deleted, you no longer have the right to access the Visual Content. Although we make a great effort to remove all of your Images from Klloom after your Visual Content is deleted, there may be a delay between the deletion event and the time your Visual Content will become publicly invisible, due to technical or operational limitations. Be aware that Klloom may keep backups of Images on its servers, and some of your Visual Content may remain on our servers (though not publicly available) even after you deleted it. In addition, your Visual Content may become permanently unrecoverable after you remove your account or Images. For that reason, you are instructed to keep your own copies of all Visual Content posted by you on the Site.</p>
            <p>2.3. Please note that nothing herein will require Klloom to cancel or alter any current license in any Image of yours that was licensed by Klloom to users before such Image was removed from the Website, unless Contributor has requested removal of the Uploaded Image due to legal concerns. Any Visual Content license issued prior to removal or termination of this Agreement will remain valid in accordance with our Terms of License. After removing your Visual Content, be aware that you must not issue any licenses that conflict with the terms of the licenses applied to the Images before they were removed from Klloom.</p>

            <h2 id="Copyright Issues">3. Copyright Issues</h2>
            <p>3.1. Klloom doesn’t claim ownership over any Visual Content that you may post on the website. However, when you transfer Visual Content to Klloom, you give us a non-exclusive, world-wide, royalty-free, perpetual, transferable license to store, use, reproduce, distribute, publicly display and license your Images to other users on your behalf. Contributor retains ownership and copyright in all uploaded Visual Content and Images shall not be considered assets of Klloom in the event of a voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy. We fully recommend that Contributor registers its Images with the Copyright Office of their country. Even though Klloom takes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the rights of its Contributors are not violated by customers or other parties, Klloom has no obligation to conduct any legal action against any alleged infringer of any rights related to any Uploaded Images.</p>

            <h2 id="Credits">4. Credits</h2>
            <p>4.1. Contributor may be in accordance with the fact that customers may not credit Contributor as the owner of the Images licensed by Klloom and that Klloom is likely to be associated with those Images as the source of the Visual Content uploaded.</p>

            <h2 id="Metadata Edit">5. Metadata Edit</h2>
            <p>5.1. Once Contributor uploads Visual Content to Klloom, Contributor acknowledges and agree that metadata may be altered, removed or added to, without any liability to Company or its customers, in order to make the information about the Visual Content more accurate and complete.</p>

            <h2 id="Grant of rights">6. Grant of rights</h2>
            <p>6.1. Even though Klloom doesn’t intend to use any Contributor’s Visual Content to promote, advertise and market Company without prior Contributor’s permission, Klloom does admit that it may be difficult for Company to control, monitor and guarantee that no Images will be displayed in our promotional and advertising content, as those Images are an inherent part of Klloom site. Therefore we hereby ask Contributor to grant, during the term of this Agreement, the right to reproduce, exhibit, transfer, broadcast, transmit and adapt any uploaded Visual Content to advertise, promote and market Klloom; and Contributor also agrees that no compensation or further permission is required for such use. Marketing may include the use of Images on social networking sites. Furthermore, the rights granted herein will include the right to use Visual Content to test or evaluate any features, technologies, systems, or processes that Klloom may use to fulfill its obligations and exercise any
                rights granted under this Agreement. The Contributor also grants the right, but not the obligation, to use Contributor’s name, trademarks and trade names. Klloom reassures you, though, that it will make great effort to ask for prior consent from all Contributors who have their Images included somehow in Company promotion, advertising or market content.</p>
            <p>6.2. When Contributor uploads Images to Klloom for licensing under our Terms of License, Contributor agrees to not distribute the Uploaded Images or any Similars for free download to any free stock image banks (such as Pexels, Pixabay and Unsplash) while the Uploaded Images are on Klloom Website. Contributor may use any Uploaded Image or Similars for personal, non-commercial purposes, such as portfolio, exhibition, single photographer publication, fine art prints, personal website and self-promotion. Contributor may also license or distribute the Upload Images to any other stock image bank, as long as it is not made available for free download. </p>

            <h2 id="Licensing Fees">7. Licensing Fees</h2>
            <p>7.1. Klloom will pay to Contributor, on a monthly basis, Forty Percent (40%) of GROSS License Fees that Company receives from the licensing of Contributor’s uploaded Images under Klloom Standard License. Forty Percent of Gross earnings is equivalent to Fifty Percent (50%) of the NET earnings from Contributor’s licensed Images. The criteria for Standard Licenses is set forth in the Company’s Terms of License.</p>
            <p>7.2. Klloom will send payments to the Contributor’s Paypal account informed by Contributor upon Sign-up process. Klloom assumes that the Paypal e-mail account informed is a valid and verified one. Please, double-check your information to ensure it is accurate. Klloom’s payment to Contributor’s Paypal account will fulfill Company’s obligation to make payments to Contributor.</p>
            <p>7.3. Contributor is entirely responsible for maintaining updated contact and payment information with Klloom. In the event Klloom is unable to contact Contributor or pay License Fees to Contributor for a period of twelve (12) months, Klloom may, in its sole discretion, terminate the Agreement and remove Contributor’s uploaded Images. Contributor’s information can be updated on the Contributor’s Account Page.</p>
            <p>7.4. In the event that a refund of a payment received or accrued from a third party is required, Klloom is fully authorized to deduct the Contributor’s share of this overpayment from any subsequent amount due the Contributor.</p>
            <p>7.5. Contributor is totally responsible for reporting their license fees income for taxation to the government of the country where Contributor is resident, when it applies. Please contact a local accountant, lawyer and/or tax advisor for specific advice according to your country’s tax law.</p>
            <p>7.6. Klloom will provide Contributor’s statement of License Fees on the Contributor’s Account Page.</p>
